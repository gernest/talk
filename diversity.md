## Qn 1:  Tell us something about yourself

__ANSWER__:

I am a self taught software developer based in Tanzania.
 I have been doing Golang development for two years now.

I like works of fiction, I like to imagine things thats why I have so much fun
when I stare at my computer.

I am the author of a couple of interesting golang
projects.[utron](https://github.com/gernest/utron) is one of
my creation , I love the way I was able to compose it with Golang, it is beautiful.

## QN 2: Can you briefly tell us about how you got to learn and use Golang

__ANSWER__:

I came across Go accidentally when I was looking for ways to have cheap
concurrency. The options at that time was either erlang or golang so I set a
time frame of one week to hack on each language and after the two weeks I picked
up Golang.


## Qn 3 Which feature(s) that you like the most in Golang?

__ANSWER__:

Almost everything about golang is awesome to me.Some aspects of Golang that I
like most includes

* Cheap concurrency. With goroutines and channels, I can model my ideas like I
am reading a bedtime story to a little kid. It is the first thing that brought
Golang to my attention and I love it.

* Tooling, the Golang tool chain is fantastic,  the `go` command is easy and neat
and all the tools under `go tools` and the other cool commands like ``go get`.

* Documentation, this is the most important of them all. With `godoc` I have the
documentation and the source code at my hand. I spend most of my time offline
and this is like heaven sent. It has helped me alot, and I prefer to read the
code than writing one. The Golang standard library is  full of treasures and
`godoc` is the magical shovel to unveil the treasure.

## What advice or action that you would give or see to help foster diversity in
Golang community worldwide?

Well, I don't think I have good answer for this, in my country(Tanzania), I
haven't met or heard about any golang developer or  any project using Golang.

The reason I prefer to keep writing good projects rather than writing blogposts
is just to convince whoever doubts that Golang is ready that Golang is ready and
It can help solve some of their problems(Our problems in my country).

I tried to Go through shops that do web development in my city( Mwanza ), and
the reaction was heart breaking. First they though I was a complete fraud,
because they believe no local person can code in a google backed programming
language. They are all PHP shops.

So I gave up on telling them how good Golang can be and instead focus on
showing them how good  Golang can be.Maybe in the future when Im very good
in Golang( well good enough for someone to think I  am good) I will start to write
about Golang in my local language( Swahuili).

## What are your advice to newcomers to Golang?

__ANSWER__:

Golang is not a black box. You can peek though it and understand how things
work.

Out of your 100% of time committed to master Golang, 80% should be on learning
programming, 15% on reading works done by other gophers( you can start on the
Golang standard library) and 5% on writing Golang code. 

## Qn 5:  Most of the current OS is written in C language. If you are going to
create a new Operating System with Golang.

What would you name your new OS?

__ANSWER__:

I will name the os MIRACLE , as it will be something that sane developers have
been praying for.
