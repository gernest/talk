# I need to borrow your spare computer for 2016, this is the reasons why!

To be sure that this text is relevant to you, [This is my GitHub
account](https://github.com/gernest). I have been programming for a while, I
maintain a [Golang web framework](https://github.com/gernest/utron) , a couple of
libraries and some interesting [open source
projects](https://github.com/gernest/hero).

I would like to borrow that computer which lies unused in your basement. The
main specification for it is it should be 64 bit and with at least 2 GB of ram,
I will explain in great details why I need it and why you should consider to put
it into good use( of course to be used by me) 


# My ticket out of poverty

I have only one way out of poverty, which is to code. I need to borrow your
spare computer because I cant afford one. I am in deep shit of poverty, and I am
fighting so hard to get away from it.

But there are a couple of good people who are willing to give me consulting
gigs, the only obstacle now is my computer cant meet some of the requirements.
For the record I am using a 32 bit dell with 2 GB of ram. It is enough to do
some of the work but I want to be professional in 2016 and keep my standards of
writing high quality software.

Your spare computer will save me and my family. I am very positive about 2016,
and my guts tells me I will beat the hell out of poverty.

# I will name my next project after you

With your spare computer I will build my next project, a fork of
[gogs](https://github.com/gogits/gogs), that
I aim to bring the benefits of github back to my country. So that people like me
will have a chance to be creative, to dream and to embrace who they
are(programmers of course).

I guarantee I can do this, I have written thousand of lines of Go, I have read
the source code of [gogs](https://github.com/gogits/gogs) like a novel. The only
thing standing between me and
this is my computer. I need to have the full power of docker, because I need the
cheapest, most efficient means of setting everything up.

I will name this project after you, and In case your have a better name for it(
your aunt or cat) I wont mind.

# I will return it back

I believe If I work hard with the right tools in 2016 i will earn enough to
afford to ship the computer back to you when you need it back. I have respect
for you, and I will respect your decisions. It is just these are desperate times
and I dont want to do something stupid thats why I asks for your help.

# My sight will be gone one day

I am short sighted, I have seen every possible doctor in my country( Tanzania )
for the past 10 years. The last visit the doc said my eyes looks just fine maybe
I had a trauma or shit like that, the thing is I cant see without zooming and
other crazy hacks and the docs have no clue, possibly because they dont have
equipments. So, If you lend me now, what will happen in the coming years wont
matter coz I will  have no regrets. I will code like crazy, all the ideas that
are floating in my mind.

# There is no future, please let me try to create one

I have no future here, to begin with I have no luck too. After publishing
[utron](https://github.com/gernest/utron) I had a lot of people interested on my
services. With poor internet
and constant power blackouts, all the hype died. They gave up on me, like
someone who is beyond saving. Now, I will have to create the future that I want
to live in. I have so much going on in my head, like ways to help revamp
industries in my country. But I need a starting point, I need to earn a living
first and thats why I am asking you just to let me try, it is not about winning,
rather its about not giving a shit and giving it a try.

# To whom it might concern

This is for anyone who thinks Im kind of a fraud, or anyone who interprets
different what I have written because he/she think she knows so much or
understand everything.

I have a message for you, "You dont know shit, about what it feels like to be
born and raised to fail".

# Summing up

It might take a lifetime to put all the reasons into writing, some things are
better left untold. I am not telling you to agree with me, I am just asking you
to think about it.I do feel bad to beg for help(Im that kind of person who likes
to be independent), but I dont have a choice. My last visit to the eye doctor( last
week) messed me up, and I dont know what else to do rather than do one thing that
I love to do before hell breaks loose.
